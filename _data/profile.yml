    Hello, I’m Sujin (Joanna). I am an apparel designer with about a decade of industry experience, and also an comptuer engineer. I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree in <b>Apparel Design</b> with a minor in <b>Computer Science</b> at Cornell University. I am advised by Dr. Fatma Baytar (Apparel Design), with Dr. Steve Marschner (Computer Science) serving as committee advisors.

      My research focuses on the intersection of <b>computer graphics</b> and <b>apparel design</b>, with an emphasis on <b>physical simulation</b>, <b> interactive/dynamic gemeotry manuplation </b> and <b>human–computer interaction (HCI)</b> applications. I am particularly interested in interactive shape manipulation for pattern making and technical design, as well as simulation methods that produce realistic garment rendering. Further details on my academic background and experience are available in my
