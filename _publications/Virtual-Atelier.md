  The Virtual Atelier is an interactive 3D fashion showroom built with React and TypeScript, using the Anigraph package and rendered with WebGL. You can walk through the showroom, view clothing items, and express reactions. This project was my first experience working with shaders and building a 3D environment without using a game engine such as Unity or Unreal. To learn more, check out the git repo or try the live demo yourself!
