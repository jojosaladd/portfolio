  SewFlex was developed as a prototype to test whether a 2D smart pattern-adjustment tool could benefit home sewers with non-standard body types and people without professional patternmaking experience. Built on the FreeSewing API, SewFlex includes a user-friendly, detailed size chart for custom measurements, a pattern editor, and an AI assistant that provides real-time pattern-adjustment guidance and suggests fit changes based on user inputs and selected body type. Findings from this prototype are informing the development of a 3D smart pattern-adjustment tool now underway. SewFlex also won first place in the HCD Graduate Student Poster Contest at Cornell University.
