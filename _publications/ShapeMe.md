  ShapeMe is a desktop application (distributed as an .exe) that lets you generate a custom 3D avatar based on one or more body measurements. The app reshapes a parametric body model in real time and allows you to export the result directly as an .obj file for use in 3D software, visualization, or apparel design workflows.
